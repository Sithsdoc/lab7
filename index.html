          You see cars are magical machines that guzzle up all your money
          because you always need to feed it, sort of like kids but less
          irritating. Cars require maintenance so they can work for long periods
          of time. Let's not forget about the warrenty you pay for which expires
          the day before your car dies making your wallet grieve more than you.

          You see besides cars sucking the money out of you more than your gold
          digger significant other, lets talk about maintenece fees. You see the
          most common issues when a car breaks down is that a part of your
          engine called the distributor doesn't work, other problems involve the
          water pump and water pump gasket. Understand any of that . . .
          Great!!!! Neither did I, and that is why auto repair shops cost so
          much money, cause most people have no idea how cars work, but o well,
          TAKE THE BUS!!!!! Good Luck.
